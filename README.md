# D5 - PHP 5.2.x Library [![Build Status](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/4af52202f/d5/status.png)](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/4af52202f/d5/latest)
## Concept
- Simple  
  include 1 file for using.  

- Mixable  
  D5 are stored to one root directory and using original AutoLoader.  
  Can mix in other library or frameworks. (but that's in some cases hell.)


# How to use
1. copy "d5" directory to your project.
2. write require in d5 using files.
```php
<?php
// Load d5 bootstrap file.
require 'd5/bs.php';

## Do anything...
```
